1)Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.

With === you test whether a value is precisely equal to the other, and with == JavaScript uses a complicated and 
confusing set of rules to determine what to do before comparing the values. In most cases, 
it just tries to convert one of the values to the other valueâ€™s type.


2)Explain what a closure is. (Note that JavaScript programs use closures very often)

A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.


3)Explain what higher order functions are.

Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them,


4)Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that uses a query selector.

The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.
When you want to get the first p element from your document
document.querySelector("p");
